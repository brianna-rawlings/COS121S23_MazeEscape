# COS121S23_MazeEscape

This project is the Maze Escape project from COS 121 at Taylor University. This project was completed duirng my freshman spring, March 2023. I worked on this project with a partner, Emersyn Funk. This project prompts the user to enter a maze (four choices to choose from), they then are prompted to choose a row and column to see if that starting point will let them exit the maze.
